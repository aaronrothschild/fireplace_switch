Since the beggining of time, people have been mesmerized by fire.  It's enchanting, entertaining and stories are told around them.  People also have wanted to control fire - so began my journey of turning on/off my fireplace from my iphone.

I could have just used some smartplug from amazon and a crusty iPhone app that I had to open...but what kind of control would that ever provide my inner neolithic man-urges?  Not much.  Cool to show and use it once.  

Also it's not very wife friendly.  She doesn't want to open an app to turn on the fireplace.  She wants a button or remote control that she can rest her fingers upon.  Not some virtual button.  The fireplace already has a remote - and she likes it.  I just want to be able to also do this from my iPhone though....

To take it to the next level - I got it to work with homekit using a project called [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) that lets you connect a LOT of different IoT type-stuff into Apple's homekit.  Homekit certification is expensive so many products only work with Alexa/Google - not HomeKit.  Bummer, but Homebridge lets you overcome that.  So yeah - I can turn on my fireplace from a shortcut on the iphone control center.  Tr√©s Cool. 

The next part that I'm working on will provide a homekit enabled button (Single Click - turns on fireplace, Double Click - turns off) that is next to my couch.  Using particle.io devices makes it easy to trigger events in other arduino devices and web APIs.  The code here is designed for [Particle.io](http://particle.io) devices, but can be slightly modified to work on a regular arduino.

This is a side-project of mine.  I wanted to learn about Arduinos and ultimately, be able to control fire.  I am not responsible for you using this code to accidentally burn down your house.  Seriously, be careful.  use at your own risk. 


What I've got here
- Some terrible code that is a result of me not knowing how to code yet
- Some pictures of my setup
- A few screenshots of my phone and Macbook controls

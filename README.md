Since the beggining of time, people have been mesmerized by fire.  It's enchanting, entertaining and stories are told around them.  People also have wanted to control fire - so began my journey of turning on/off my fireplace from my iphone.

I could have just made a switch that uses some crusty iPhone app that I had to open...but what kind of control would that ever provide my inner neolithic man-urges.  Not much.  Cool to show and use it once.  Also it's not very wife friendly.  She doesn't want to open an app to turn on the fireplace.  She wants a button or remote control that she can rest her fingers upon.  Not some virtual button.  The fireplace already has a remote - and she likes it.  I just want to be able to also do this from my iPhone though....

To take it to the next level - I got it to work with homekit using a project called Homebridge (check it on github yo).  So yeah - I can turn on my fireplace from a shortcut on the iphone control center.  Tres Cool. 

The next part that I'm working on will provide a homekit enabled button (Single Click - turns on fireplace, Double Click - turns off) that is next to my couch.  Using particle.io devices makes it easy to trigger events in other arduino devices and web APIs.  The code here is designed for (Particle.io)[http://particle.io] devices, but can be slightly modified to work on a regular arduino.

This is a side-project of mine.  I wanted to learn about Arduinos and ultimately, be able to control fire.  I am not responsible for you using this code to accidentally burn down your house.  Seriously, be careful.  use at your own risk.
